	    <div class="par_text"> 
	      Suppose you bought a (one-way) ticket from San Francisco International (SFO) to Newark Liberty
	      International (EWR) for
	      travel on May 1, 2017, on American Airlines for 250 USD.
	      But at the same time you are uncertain
	      whether this will be the date you want to fly - perhaps you have business meetings, perhaps
	      you are uncertain if you want to visit a friend you haven't seen in a while. A few extra days,
	      let's say
	      until May 5, would be a great relief. American Airlines offers the flexible ticket for that period,
	      but the costs can be prohibitive. The other
	      possibility is that you change the ticket - this is usually quite expensive. You will be liable
	      for the entire ticket price increase as well as the penalty fee that the airline charges.
	    </div>	    
	    <div class="par_text">
	      Luckily you have another option - <i>Air Options</i>. By purchasing Air Options flight change
	      option we will reimburse
	      you for the entire price increase.
	      For example, if you purchased the option for 50 USD and the price of the ticket that you want to change
	      to increases to 400 USD, we will reimburse you the 150 USD (=400 USD - 250 USD) price increase.
	      Unfortunately we can't reimburse you for the penalty fee, as the airlines charge this no matter what -
	      but be assured we are working on that :)

	    <div class="par_text"> 
	      <ul>
		<li>Select the appropriate origin and destination airport, carrier, cabin class. Airports and airlines (carriers) autocomplete, which can help you select them. You can select IATA code for the airport.
		</li>
		<li> Select the start/end date for your changed flight. In case you have selected a one-way flight, you need only complete the "Departure start" and "Departure end" fields. In case of a return flight, you also need to complete "Return start" and "Return end" date fields.
		</li>
		<li> Once the dates are selected, click <b>Find flights</b>.
		  In the fields below two things will appear:
		  (a) the prices of option to change and
		  (b) all the flights that this option entitles you to.
		</li>
		<li> There are 3 options that are available to you - roughly by thirds until flight maturity.
		  If the option displayed is: "Book departure until 4/18/2017, return until 4/21/2017"
		  you may change the departure ticket to any of the flights displayed below until the date
		  indicated. Similar for the return ticket, if applicable.
		</li>
		<li> Usually you do not want to change the flight to all selected flight - in that case you can
		  select/deselect the flights presented below. After you have selected the appropriate
		  change flights, click <b>Recompute</b>. This will recompute the change option for
		  the particular flights selected.
		</li>
		<li> Once you have selected your desired flights and air option time interval, click the button.
		  This will bring you to the booking area, where you can fill in your credit card details.
		  Once you choose <b>Pay!</b> the AirOption LLC will check all the booking details,
		  and if everything is in order, bring you to the invoice screen and send a mail with
		  your invoice attached. 		  
		</li>
		<li>In case you want to send AirOptions a message, click on the <b>Send inquiry</b> button
		  and fill the appropriate fields.
		</li>

	    <div class="par_text">
	      <p> <b>Do-s:</b>
		<ul>
		  <li> You can only change the ticket until the date indicated in the contract - if that date is April 1,
		    and you change the ticket on April 10 - we will not reimburse you in that case.
		  </li>
		  <li> <b>You have to present the change contract to us in order to verify that you indeed
		    changed the ticket to one of the selected flights.</b>
		  </li>
		</ul>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		<b>Don't-s:</b>
		<ul>
		  <li><b>We can't waive the change penalty, only the price increase.</b>
		    You can not change to any ticket that you please - you can only change to the flights that
		    you specified in the contract.
		  </li>
		  <li> We can only change <i>direct flight tickets</i>, not the layover ones.
		  </li>
		  <li>The selected departure and return intervals should not be too wide.
		    In case they are, Air Options needs to retrieve all the flights for every
		    selected day in your time interval. If you need such large range or customized
		    search, please send us an inquiry and we will do contact you soon.
